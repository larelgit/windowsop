## Phase 1: Preparing a Clean System

To begin, we require a clean slate, meaning a fresh installation of the Windows operating system. Concerning the choice of Windows version to install, I generally discourage the use of custom Windows builds. Many of these builds can be poorly constructed, riddled with bugs, or contain malware.

However, I recommend considering either the standard LTSC version of Windows or an assembly from Flibustier. The Flibustier assembly incorporates a variety of system optimizations and eliminates superfluous functions and programs. Feel free to opt for the version that best suits your preferences and comfort level, especially if you harbor reservations about installing custom builds.
